I'm publicly committing to the 100DaysOfCode Challenge starting today! Learn More and Join me! 
https://100DaysOfCode.com #100DaysOfCode

### R0D1 
Starting from the ground up. Learning the basics of HTML from 
@freeCodeCamp and checking more advanced use of it with other resources. #100DaysOfCode

### R0D2
Still going with HTML. Finish @freeCodeCamp HTML chapter. Build several html pages that look like 
was written before internet was a thing, ðŸ¤¦but CSS in on the way soon. #100DaysOfCode

### R0D3
More HTML. Awfull tables without CSS where most of elements are deprecated since they push 
everything to CSS now. Ending @yu_angela HTML part of #webdevelopment #bootcamp from 
@LondonAppBrewer in @udemy. I should go starting CSS soon, hate ugly UI/UX. #100DaysOfCode

### FAIL CHALLENGE

the pace in the challenge. So tomorrow, day 1 again gone use it to recap the first 3 days and resume 
the path.
