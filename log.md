**Today's Progress**: No progress just giving the first step and its a lot.
**Thoughts:** 
Committing to 100 days of code, everyday will not be easy since the "real life" will
be messing this up for sure, but we have to try, after all humans already go to the moon and trying
go to Mars now.

### Day 7: January 20, 2020
**Today's Progress**: Didnt code at all today but i feel the need of know how to better use VSCode
So i spend my learning time today learning more about it. How to use terminal, install extensions 
and what essential extentions should install. Using source control with GIT. Adjusting some editor
configurations to code easier.
**Thoughts** 
I like VSCode
